But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knigts had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.{Laughing} </p>

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. She was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead. The years start comin' and they don't stop comin'. Fed to the rules and hit the ground runnin'. Didn't make sense not to live for fun. Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb.</p>

The water's getting warm so you might as well swim. My world's on fire. How 'bout yours? That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored.</p>
