I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. She was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead. The years start comin' and they don't stop comin'. Fed to the rules and hit the ground runnin'. Didn't make sense not to live for fun. Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb. So much to do so much to see, so what's wrong with takin' the backstreets. You'll never know if you don't go. You'll never shine if you don't glow. Hey, now You're an all-star. Get your game on, go play. Hey, now You're a rock star. Get the show on, get paid and all that glitters is gold. Only shootin' stars break the mold. It's a cool place and they say it gets colder.

The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin. The water's getting warm so you might as well swim. My world's on fire. How 'bout yours? That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored. Hey, now, you're an all-star. {Shouting} Get your game on, go play. Hey, now You're a rock star. Get the show on, get paid and all that glitters is gold. Only shootin' stars break the mold. {Belches} Go! Go! </p>
          <p>{Record Scratching} Go. Go. Go. Hey, now, you're an all-star. Get your game on, go play. Hey, now You're a rock star. Get the show on, get paid and all that glitters is gold. Only shootin' stars break the mold.</p>
