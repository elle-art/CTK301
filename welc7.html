      <h2> Once Upon A Time...</h2>
      <p id="hm">{Man} Once upon a time there was a lovely princess, but she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knigts had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. {Laughing} Like that's ever gonna happen. {Paper Rusting, Toilet Flushes} What a load of--</p>

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. She was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead. The years start comin' and they don't stop comin'. Fed to the rules and hit the ground runnin'. Didn't make sense not to live for fun. Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb. So much to do so much to see, so what's wrong with takin' the backstreets. You'll never know if you don't go. You'll never shine if you don't glow. Hey, now You're an all-star. Get your game on, go play. Hey, now You're a rock star. Get the show on, get paid and all that glitters is gold. Only shootin' stars break the mold. It's a cool place and they say it gets colder. You're bundled up now but wait till you get older, but the meteor men beg to differ judging by the hole in the satellite picture. The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin. The water's getting warm so you might as well swim. My world's on fire. How 'bout yours? That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored. Hey, now, you're an all-star. {Shouting} Get your game on, go play. Hey, now You're a rock star. Get the show on, get paid and all that glitters is gold. Only shootin' stars break the mold. {Belches} Go! Go! {Record Scratching} Go. Go. Go. Hey, now, you're an all-star. Get your game on, go play. Hey, now You're a rock star. Get the show on, get paid and all that glitters is gold. Only shootin' stars break the mold.

Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread. {Laughs} Yes, well, actually, that would be a gaint. Now, ogres - - They're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. No! They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! {Gasping} Right. {Roaring} {Shouting} {Roaring} {Whispers} This is the part where you run away. {Gasping} {Laughs} {Laughing} And stay out!</p>
          <p> "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures." {Sighs} {Man's voice} All right. This one's full. Take it away! {Gasps} Move it along. Come on! Get up! Next! Give me that! Your fiying days are over. That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! Get up! Come on! Twenty pieces. {Thudding} Sit down there! Keep quiet! {Crying} This cage is too small. Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! Oh, shut up. Oh! Next! What have you got? This little wooden puppet. I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. Father, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!</p>
